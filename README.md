## **Methodology**

### **1. Sales Data Analysis**
- **Scope**: Evaluated sales data from 2019 through 2024 for the **Rain Wild Chronicles** and other related series.
- **Metrics**:
  - Yearly sales trends by format (mass market paperback, e-books, audiobooks).
  - Weekly sales averages for each title.
  - Performance compared to similar titles in the universe.

### **2. Comparative Analysis**
- Benchmarked the **Rain Wild Chronicles** against:
  - The **Fitz and the Fool Trilogy**.
  - Other reprinted series by Robin Hobb.
- Analyzed search term performance and Amazon click-through data for discoverability.

### **3. Metadata and Marketing Strategy**
- Updated metadata for enhanced SEO:
  - New BISAC categories (e.g., **Fantasy Romance**, **YA Fantasy**, **Coming of Age**).
  - Removed outdated categories (e.g., **Middle Grade**, **Fiction/Animals**).
- Expanded off-page keywords to reflect broader audience interests, including:
  - **Dragon Riders**, **Found Family**, **Queer Romance**, **Lost City**.

## **Results**
- **Sales Insights**:
  - Mass market paperback sales showed steady declines, with average yearly sales for the series under 700 units per title (except **Dragon Keeper** due to promotions).
  - E-book promotions boosted **Dragon Keeper** significantly but had limited effects on the rest of the series.
  - Nearly 50% of Robin Hobb’s sales now stem from audiobook subscriptions, signaling a shift in consumer behavior.

- **Discoverability Issues**:
  - The series is primarily found through direct searches for the title or author, unlike competitors benefiting from broader term searches.

- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Enhanced metadata and positioning to align with contemporary trends and keywords.
  - Focused marketing campaigns targeting e-book and audiobook audiences.
