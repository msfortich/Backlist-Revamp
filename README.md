# **Rain Wild Chronicles Revamp**

## **Project Overview**
This project aimed to revitalize Robin Hobb’s **Rain Wild Chronicles** series through a comprehensive analysis of sales trends and new marketing strategies. In collaboration with fellow interns, a comparative analysis of sales data since 2019 was conducted, focusing on the series’ performance within the **Realm of the Elderlings** universe. This analysis informed the development of new positioning and marketing strategies designed to boost visibility, appeal, and sales. Note: The accompanying PDF file and notebook represents only my portion of the presentation, focusing on the analysis and strategy development I contributed to this collaborative project.
